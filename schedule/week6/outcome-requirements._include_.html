        <p><strong>A <em>software requirement</em> specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</strong></p>
        <p>A software project may be,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a <em>brown-field</em> project: develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>
          <li>a <em>green-field</em> project: develop a totally new system with no precedent</li>

        <p><strong>Non-functional requirements are easier to miss.</strong> We should spend extra effort in digging them out as early as possible because sometimes they are critical to the success of the software. <span class="dimmed">Â E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionality.</span></p>

        <p><strong>Requirements can be prioritized based the importance and urgency</strong>, while keeping in mind the constraints of schedule, budget, staff resources, quality goals, and other constraints.</p>
        <p>A common approach is to group requirements into priority categories. Note that all such scales are subjective, and stakeholders define the meaning of each level in the scale for the project at hand.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>ðŸ“¦ An example scheme for categorizing requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Essential</code>: The product must have this requirement fulfilled else it does not get user acceptance</li>
            <li><code>Typical</code>: Most similar systems have this feature although the product can survive without it.</li>
            <li><code>Novel</code>: New features that could differentiate this product from the rest.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>ðŸ“¦ Other schemes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>Low</code></li>
            <li><code>Must-have</code>, <code>Nice-to-have</code>, <code>Unlikely-to-have</code></li>
