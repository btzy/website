**Acceptable**: Evidence of following a coding standard in any project.

**Suggested**: Go through the [provided Java coding standard](https://oss-generic.github.io/process/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Java.html). Identify and fix any violations of _basic_ style rules in local copy of addressbook-level1 code base. Commit after each fix.

**Submission**: Show the relevant commits during the tutorial.
