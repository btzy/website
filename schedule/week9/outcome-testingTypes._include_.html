        <p><strong><em>System testing</em>: take the <em>whole system</em> and test it <em>against the system specification</em>.</strong></p>
        <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
        <p><strong>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.</strong> Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' having pushed
          beyond its limits.</p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>ðŸ“¦ Suppose the SUT is a browser capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. Given below is a test case to test if the SUT fails gracefully if pushed beyond its limits.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>Test case: load a web page that is too big
* Input: load a web page containing more than 5000 characters. 
* Expected behavior: abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message. 
</code></pre>
          <p>This test case would fail if the browser attempted to load the large file anyway and crashed.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p><strong>System testing includes testing against non-functional requirements too.</strong> Here are some examples.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Performance testing</em> â€“ to ensure the system responds quickly.</li>
          <li><em>Load testing</em> (also called <em>stress testing</em> or <em>scalability testing</em>) â€“ to ensure the system can work under heavy load.</li>
          <li><em>Security testing</em> â€“ to test how secure the system is.</li>
          <li><em>Compatibility testing, interoperability testing</em> â€“ to check whether the system can work with other systems.</li>
          <li><em>Usability testing</em> â€“ to test how easy it is to use the system.</li>
          <li><em>Portability testing</em> â€“ to test whether the system works on different platforms.</li>

        <p>If a software product has a GUI component, all product-level testing (i.e. the types of testing mentioned above) need to be done using the GUI. However, <strong>testing the GUI is much harder than testing the CLI (command line interface) or API</strong>,
          for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most GUIs can support a large number of different operations, many of which can be performed in any arbitrary order.</li>
          <li>GUI operations are more difficult to automate than API testing. Reliably automating GUI operations and automatically verifying whether the GUI behaves as expected is harder than calling an operation and comparing its return value with an expected
            value. Therefore, automated regression testing of GUIs is rather difficult.</li>
          <li>The appearance of a GUI (and sometimes even behavior) can be different across platforms and even environments. For example, a GUI can behave differently based on whether it is minimized or maximized, in focus or out of focus, and in a high resolution
            display or a low resolution display.</li>
        </ul><img src="/website/book/testing/testAutomation/testingGuis/images/diagram.png" height="120">
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>One approach to overcome the challenges of testing GUIs is to minimize logic aspects in the GUI.</strong> Then, bypass the GUI to test the rest of the system using automated API testing. While this still requires the GUI to be tested manually,
          the number of such manual test cases can be reduced as most of the system has been tested using automated API testing.</p>
        <p><strong>There are testing tools that can automate GUI testing.</strong></p>

        <tip-box>
          <p><strong>Requirement Specification vs System Specification</strong></p>
          <p>The requirement specification need not be the same as the system specification. Some example differences:</p>
          <table class="markbind-table table">
            <thead>
              <tr>

              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align:left">limited to how the system behaves in normal working conditions</td>
                <td style="text-align:left">can also include details on how it will fail gracefully when pushed beyond limits, how to recover, etc. specification</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align:left">written in terms of problems that need to be solved (e.g. provide a method to locate an email quickly)</td>
                <td style="text-align:left">written in terms of how the system solve those problems (e.g. explain the email search feature)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align:left">specifies the interface available for intended end-users</td>
                <td style="text-align:left">could contain additional APIs not available for end-users (for the use of developers/testers)</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>However, <strong>in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</strong></p>
        </tip-box>
        <p><strong>Passing system tests does not necessarily mean passing acceptance testing.</strong> Some examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The system might work on the testbed environments but might not work the same way in the deployment environment, due to subtle differences between the two environments.</li>
          <li>The system might conform to the system specification but could fail to solve the problem it was supposed to solve for the user, due to flaws in the system design.</li>
