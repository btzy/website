#### Project Portfolio Page (PPP)

At the end of the project each student is required to submit a _Project Portfolio Page_.

* **Objective:** 
  * For you to use %%&nbsp;(e.g. in your resume)%% as a well-documented data point of your SE experience 
  * For us to use as a data point to evaluate your,
    * contributions to the project
    * your documentation skills

* **What to include:**
  * Main things to include: 
    * links to collated code
    * features you implemented %%&nbsp;(include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide)%%
    * features you propose to implement in future %%&nbsp;(include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide if applicable)%%<br>
      Note: the purpose of allowing you to include _proposed_ features is to provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. %%&nbsp;e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.%%
    * other significant contributions to the project %%&nbsp;e.g. tweaks to existing features, setting up project tools%%
  * Other things you can include: 
    * Evidence of helping others %%&nbsp;e.g. responses you posted in our forum, bugs you reported in other team's products%%, 
    * Evidence of technical leadership %%&nbsp;e.g. offering features for others to reuse, evidence of those features being reused by others%%
  * If you plan to use the PPP in your Resume, you can also include your SE work outside of the module (will not be graded)

* **Format**:
  * Page limit: If you have more content than the limit given below, shorten (or omit some content) so that you do not exceed the page limit. Having too much content in the PPP will be viewed unfavorably during grading. Note: the ==page limits given below are _after_ converting to PDF format==. The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML â†’ PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.
    Content | Limit
    ------- | -----
    Description in point form | 0.5-1
    Extracts from the User Guide | 1-3
    Extracts from the Developer Guide | 3-6
    Total | 5-10
  * :package: Follow the [example in the AddressBook-Level4](https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/addressbook-level4/team/johndoe.html).
  * :bulb: You can use the [Asciidoc's `include` feature](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#include-files) to include sections from the developer guide or the user guide in your PPP. Follow the example in the [sample](https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/addressbook-level4/team/johndoe.html). 
  * ==:exclamation: It is assumed that all contents in the PPP were written primarily by you.== If any section is written by someone else %%&nbsp;e.g. someone else wrote described the feature in the User Guide but you implemented the feature%%, clearly state that the section was written by someone else %%&nbsp;(e.g. `Start of Extract [from: User Guide] written by Jane Doe`)%%. %%&nbsp;Reason: Your writing skills will be evaluated based on the PPP%%
