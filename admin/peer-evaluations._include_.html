<p>We use the <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/">TEAMMATES</a> online peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations. All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks. The system also
  allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Requirements:</strong> [considered for participation marks]</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ùóÔ∏è Submitting peer evaluations is compulsory. <mark>If you routinely miss submitting peer evaluations, you forfeit your participation marks.</mark></li>
<li>üí° TEAMMATES normally allows students to access it without using Google login. In this module, we encourage you to login to TEAMMATES using your Google account and complete your profile with a suitable profile photo. <span class="dimmed">¬†Reason:CS2103 is a big class. This profile helps us to remember you better, even after the module is over.</span></li>

        <p>The purpose of the profile photo is for the teaching team to identify you. Therefore, you should choose a recent individual photo showing your face clearly. Some examples can be seen in the 'Teaching team' page. Given below are some examples of
          good and bad profile photos.<br>

      <li>
        <p>If you are uncomfortable posting your photo due to security reasons, you can post a lower resolution image so that it is hard for someone to misused that image for fraudulent purposes. If you are concerned about privacy, you can request permission
          to omit your photo from the page by writing to prof.</p>

<span id="giving-peer-feedback">
<p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. Half-hearted/trivial feedback will not earn participation marks.</p>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li>
<li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li>
<li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li></ul></span>
<p>The final peer evaluation (in week 13) is graded. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to evaluate the work of your team members. The quality and accuracy of your evaluation will affect your grade and your evaluations will be considered as a data
  point in determining the grade of the team members.</p>
