    <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
    <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
      status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
    <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
          <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
          <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëç Good:¬†Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5</span></li>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëé Bad¬†(reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough):¬†Write the project manual</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a¬†single person¬†to do¬†within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Implementing parser</code>¬† <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
          <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code>¬†<span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description
          is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br>
        <mark>Here are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly wrapped up</mark>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br>
            <img src="/website/admin/images/assigningIssuesToMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br>
            <img src="/website/admin/images/closingMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

  <p>üí° <strong>If the project is too difficult for you to keep up with, there is an easier path</strong></p>
  <p>As CS2103/T is a core module for Computing students, the project standards are set high enough to train students for a CS/SE career. However, some of you may not have gained enough pre-requisite skills (possibly because you don't plan for a CS/SE-related
    career, or for some other reason) in previous modules to be able to survive a code base such as AddressBook-Level4 (AB4). Based on your v1.0-1.2 experience, you should now be able to decide weather you are in that category.</p>
  <p>If you think you are in that category <span class="dimmed">¬†(e.g. you haven't managed to merge any code to AB4 code base yet in spite of much trying)</span> and you fear that you are not going to learn much by continuing to struggle in the AB4 code
    base, we are willing to let you go back to AB3 or AB2 code base and use that for your project instead. This decision can be made as a team or individually. We'll use the same criteria for grading your project either way, but naturally, work done in
    AB2/AB3 is going to earn significantly less marks than similar work done in AB4. If you want to take that option, please email us know before v1.3 deadline.</p>

<h3 id="v13-project-management">v1.3 Project Management</h3>
<tip-box type="important">
  <p>Starting from this version, you are <em>required</em> to, <strong>do a proper product release</strong> as described in the Developer Guide.</p>
</tip-box>
<tip-box>
  <p>üí° Ensure that <strong>each PR that adds an enhancement also updates the relevant parts of documents and tests</strong>. That way, your documentation/testing work will not pile up towards the end.</p>
</tip-box>
<p>As before, the milestone v1.3 must be wrapped up on GitHub. Remember to <mark>move all incomplete issues to a future milestone and <em>close</em> the milestone</mark> so that it no longer appears under <em>open</em> milestones.</p>
<h3 id="v13-product">v1.3 Product</h3>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Do a release on GitHub</p>
<h3 id="v13-documentation">v1.3 Documentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Guide</strong>: Update where the document does not match the current product.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Guide</strong>: Similar to User Guide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Must be included in the version tagged <code>v1.3</code>.</p>
<h3 id="v13-demo">v1.3 Demo</h3>
<p>Do an informal demo of the new features during the tutorial. Each person should demo their own contributions.</p>
<tip-box type="important">
  <p>Starting from this version, you should <strong>use the jar file</strong> (downloaded from GitHub release) for the demo, not the code loaded into the IDE.</p>
