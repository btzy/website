      <li><em>Team lead</em>: Responsible for overall project coordination.</li>
      <li><em>Documentation</em> (short for â€˜in charge of documentationâ€™): Responsible for the quality of various project documents.</li>

      <li><em>Integration</em>: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository, integrating various parts of the software to create a whole.</li>
