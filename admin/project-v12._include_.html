<h3 id="v12-project-management">v1.2 Project Management</h3>
<tip-box type="important">
  <p>Starting from this version, <mark>there are additional requirements to follow</mark> regarding how you <strong>use GitHub to manage your milestones</strong>, as described in
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-projectTracking">[Admin ¬ª Appendix E: GitHub: Project Schedule Tracking]</trigger>.</p>
</tip-box>
<p>As before, you are <em>recommended</em> (but not required) to <strong>follow the forking workflow</strong> when evolving the product.</p>
<modal large="" title="Admin ¬ª Appendix E: Github: Project Schedule Tracking" id="modal:v12-projectTracking">
  <div>
    <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
    <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
      status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
    <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g.</span><code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br><code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëç Good:¬†Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5</span></li>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëé Bad¬†(reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough):¬†Write the project manual</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a¬†single person¬†to do¬†within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Implementing parser</code><span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
          <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code><span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong><span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description
          is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="using-milestones">
      <h3 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br><mark>Here are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly wrapped up</mark>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br><img src="/website/admin/images/assigningIssuesToMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br><img src="/website/admin/images/closingMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

<ul>
  <li>[Preferred] Deliver it in smaller incremental steps e.g. deliver a basic version of the enhancement first.</li>

<h3 id="v12-product">v1.2 Product</h3>
<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update code in GitHub.</p>
<tip-box>
  <p>üí° <strong>If tests are causing too much pain ...</strong></p>
  <p>Automated tests have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.</p>
  <p>If you find tests too big a burden, it is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated test coverage you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under
    the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.</p>
  <p>Also note
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>
  <modal title="Admin ¬ª Project Asessement ‚Üí Expectation on testing" id="modal:v12-testingExpectations">
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk
          of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
        <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
          extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because
          the code has low testability.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User Guide</strong>: Update as necessary.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a feature has been released in this version, replace the <code>Coming in v2.0</code> annotation with a <code>Since v1.2</code>. Also replace UI mockups with actual screenshots.</li>
      <li>If a feature design has changed, update the descriptions accordingly.</li>

    <p><strong>Developer Guide</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark>Each member should describe the implementation of at least one enhancement she has added</mark> (or planning to add). <br> Expected length: 1+ page per person</li>
      <li>The description can contain things such as,
        <ul>
          <li>How the feature is implemented.</li>
          <li>Why it is implemented that way.</li>
          <li>Alternatives considered.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The stated objective is to explain the implementation to a future developer, but a hidden objective is to show evidence that you can document deeply-technical content using prose, examples, diagrams, code snippets, etc. appropriately. To that end,
        you may also describe features that you plan to implement in the future, even beyond v1.5 (hypothetically).</li>
      <li>For an example, see <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s2.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#undo-redo-mechanism">the description of the undo/redo feature implementation in the AddressBook-Level4 developer guide</a>.</li>
