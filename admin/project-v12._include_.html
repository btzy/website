<tip-box type="important">
  <p>Starting from this version, <mark>there are additional requirements to follow</mark> regarding how you <strong>use GitHub to manage your milestones</strong>, as described in
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-projectTracking">[Admin ¬ª Appendix E: GitHub: Project Schedule Tracking]</trigger>.</p>
</tip-box>
<p>As before, you are <em>recommended</em> (but not required) to <strong>follow the forking workflow</strong> when evolving the product.</p>
<modal large="" title="Admin ¬ª Appendix E: Github: Project Schedule Tracking" id="modal:v12-projectTracking">

  <div>
    <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
    <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
      status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
    <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
          <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
          <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëç Good:¬†Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5</span></li>
          <li><span class="dimmed">üëé Bad¬†(reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough):¬†Write the project manual</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a¬†single person¬†to do¬†within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Implementing parser</code>¬† <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
          <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code>¬†<span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description
          is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="using-milestones">
      <h3 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br>
        <mark>Here are the conditions to satisfy for a milestone to be considered properly wrapped up</mark>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br>
            <img src="/website/admin/images/assigningIssuesToMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milestone closed. If there are incomplete issues or unmerged PRs in the milestone, move them to a future milestone.<br>
            <img src="/website/admin/images/closingMilestones.png" width="700"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>

  <p>üí° <strong>If tests are causing too much pain ...</strong></p>
  <p>Automated tests have benefits, but they can be a pain to write/maintain; GUI tests are especially hard to maintain because their behavior can sometimes depend on things such as the OS, resolution etc.</p>
  <p>If you find tests too big a burden, it is OK to get rid of some of the troublesome tests and rely more on manual testing instead. The less automated test coverage you have, the higher the risk of regressions; but it may be an acceptable trade-off under
    the circumstances if tests are slowing you down too much.</p>
  <p>Also note
    <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-testingExpectations">our expectation on test code</trigger>.</p>
  <modal title="Admin ¬ª Project Asessement ‚Üí Expectation on testing" id="modal:v12-testingExpectations">
  
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk
          of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
        <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
          extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because
          the code has low testability.</li>

  <p>üí° We use a tool called <em>Collate</em> to extract out code written by each member in your final project submission. The tool requires you to annotate code with special tags to mark code written by you. Adding those annotations is usually done at v1.4
    but you are welcome to start early.</p>
  <panel header="**How to collate code for grading**" no-close="">
    <div>
      <p>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.</p>
      <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
        <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
        <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
      </ol>
      <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>            tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the GitHub
            username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;
&lt;textbox&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;...&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input&gt;...&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/textbox&gt;
...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments</strong> as only the content below that tag will be collated.<br> üëé‚§µÔ∏è

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Annotate both functional and test code but not documentation files.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>            but allowed. If you do, do it sparingly and only claim meaningful blocks of code such as a block of statements, a loop, or an if-else statement%%.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
            <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
            <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
            <li>üí° GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Do not try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code blocks
            within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member claiming
            credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product</strong>,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
            <li>Move unused files (or copies of files containing unused code) to that folder</li>
            <li>use <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}-unused</code> to mark unused code in those files (note the suffix <code>unused</code>) e.g.

          </ul>
          <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe-unused
