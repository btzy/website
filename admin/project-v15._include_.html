        the product.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product. This is the first time they are seeing the new product you developed but they
        are familiar with the AddressBook-level4 (AB4) product.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Scope</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Each person should demo the enhancements they added</strong>. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.</li>
        <li>Subjected to the constraint mentioned in the previous point, as far as possible, organize the demo to present a cohesive picture of the product as a whole, presented in a logical order. <span class="dimmed">¬†Remember to explain the profile of the target user profile and value proposition early in the demo.</span></li>
        <li>It is recommended you showcase how the feature improves the user‚Äôs life rather than simply describe each feature.</li>
        <li>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.</li>
        <li>Mention features you inherited from AB4 only if they are needed to explain your new features. <span class="dimmed">¬†Reason: existing features will not earn you marks, and the audience is already familiar with AB4 features.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.</li>
        <li>It can be <strong>a <em>sitting down</em> demo</strong>: You'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down. But you may stand around the TV if you prefer that way.</li>
        <li>It will be uninterrupted demo: The audience members will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
        <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start. <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g at least 20 contacts</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br> Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch or
          an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don‚Äôt need to act like an imaginary user. For example, [Instead of this]<code>Jim get‚Äôs a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code>          [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type ‚Ä¶</code><br> It‚Äôs not that dramatization is bad or we don‚Äôt like it. We simply don‚Äôt have enough time for it.<br> Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context
          ‚Üí Different requirements.</li>
        <li>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo. <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark></li>
        <li>Don‚Äôt waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. e.g. no need to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</li>
        <li>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just 1-2 sample data creates a bad impression
          too.</li>
        <li>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to perform a task before you show the full command with all the bells and whistles.</li>
        <li>Limit the demo to CLI inputs only. There is no point explaining GUI inputs because they don't earn marks.</li>

          <p><strong>A. Cohesiveness of product features</strong> [üë•]: Do the major features fit together and match the stated target user and the value proposition?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>low</code>: One of these
              <ul>
                <li>target user is too general <span class="dimmed">¬†i.e. not narrower than AB4</span></li>

          <p><strong>B. Quality of user docs</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate based on the parts of the user guide written by the person, as reproduced in the project portfolio. <mark>Evaluate from an end-user perspective.</mark></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>low</code>: Hard to understand, often inaccurate or missing important information</li>

          <p><strong>C. Amount of work</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate the amount of work on a scale of 0 to 30</p>

            <li>Consider <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/440/files">this PR (<code>history</code> command)</a> as 5 units of effort which means <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/610/files">this PR (<code>undo/redo</code> command)</a>              is about 15 points of effort. Given that 30 points matches an effort twice as that needed for the <code>undo/redo</code> feature (which was given as an example of an <code>A</code> grade project), we expect most students to be have efforts
              lower than 20.</li>
            <li>Count all implementation/testing/documentation work as mentioned in that person's portfolio page.</li>
            <li>‚ùóÔ∏è Do not give a high value just <em>to be nice</em>. If your estimate is wildly inaccurate, it means you are unable to estimate the effort required to implement a feature in a project that you are supposed to know well at this point. <mark>You will lose marks if that is the case.</mark></li>
            <li>When estimating effort, ignore features that are driven by GUI inputs.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><code>low</code> : an easy feature <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. make the existing <em>find</em> command case insensitive</span></li>

                <li>A moderately difficult feature but fully implemented <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. an <em>edit</em> command that allows editing any field</span></li>
                <li>A difficult feature with a reasonable implementation but some aspects are not covered <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that only allows a single undo/redo</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code>excellent</code>: A difficult feature, all reasonable aspects are fully implemented <span class="dimmed">¬†undo/redo command that allows multiple undo/redo</span></li>

          <p><strong>E. Quality of developer docs</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate based on the developer docs cited/reproduced in the respective project portfolio page. <mark>Evaluate from the perspective of a new developer trying to understand how the features are implemented.</mark></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>low</code>: One of these
              <ul>
                <li>Very small amount of content (i.e., 0.5 - 1 page)</li>
                <li>Hardly any use to the reader (i.e., content doesn't make much sense or redundant)</li>
                <li>Uses ad-hoc diagrams where UML diagrams could have been used instead</li>

            <li><code>medium</code>: <em>Some</em> diagrams, <em>some</em> descriptions, but does not help the reader that much <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. overly complicated diagrams</span></li>
            <li><code>high</code>: Enough diagrams (at lest two kinds of UML diagrams used) and enough descriptions (about 2 pages worth) but explanations are not always easy to follow.</li>
            <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow. Just enough information (not too much). Minimum repetition of content/diagrams. Good use of diagrams to complement text descriptions. Easy to understand diagrams with just enough details rather than
              very complicated diagrams that are hard to understand.</li>
            <li><code>unable to judge</code>: One of these
              <ul>
                <li>no content at all</li>
                <li>less than 0.5 pages worth of content</li>

  <p><strong>Bug Review Period</strong>:</p>
  <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
  <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Wednesday midnight</strong>.</p>
  <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>

    <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not
          harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description. Do not close bug reports.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag. In addition, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a>          to indicate which issue they are duplicates of. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <tip-box>
      <p>Response Labels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>response.Accepted</code> : You accept it as a bug.</li>
        <li><code>response.Rejected</code> : What tester thought as a bug is in fact expected behavior. ‚ùóÔ∏è The penalty for rejecting a bug using an unjustifiable explanation is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can also reject bugs
          that you inherited from AB4.</li>
        <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code> : You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>
        <li><code>response.IssueUnclear</code> : The issue description is not clear.</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <ul>
      <li>If applicable, <strong>decide the type of bug</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <tip-box>
      <p>Bug Type Labels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>type-FunctionalityBug</code> : the bug is a flaw in how the product works</li>
        <li><code>type-DocumentationBug</code> : the bug is in the documentation</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Suggest a severity for the bug</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <tip-box>
        <p>Bug Severity labels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>severity.Low</code> : A flaw that is unlikely to affect normal operations of the product. Appears only in very rare situations and causes a minor inconvenience only.</li>
          <li><code>severity.Medium</code> : A flaw that causes occasional inconvenience to some users but they can continue to use the product.</li>
          <li><code>severity.High</code> : A flaw that affects most users and causes major problems for users. i.e., makes the product almost unusable for most users.</li>
        </ul>
      </tip-box>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Decide who should fix the bug</strong>. Use the <code>Assignees</code> field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility. <strong>If there is no assignee and we are unable to determine a suitable assignee ourselves, we'll have no choice but to distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) among all team members.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Add an explanatory comment</strong> explaining your choice of labels and assignees.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </tip-box>
  <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your performance in the practical exam will be considered for your final grade (under the <em>QA</em> category and under <em>Implementation</em> category, about 10 marks in total).</li>
    <li>You will lose marks if you missed too many bugs in the product you tested or your evaluation/estimates are significantly off from the evaluator consensus. <span class="dimmed">¬†Explanation: we penalize if your inputs don't seem be be based on a sincere effort to test/evaluate.</span></li>
    <li>The bugs found in your product by others will affect your v1.5 marks. You will be given a chance to reject false-positive bug reports.</li>
  </ul>
