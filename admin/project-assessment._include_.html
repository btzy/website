                <li><code>low</code>: One of these
                  <ul>
                    <li>target user is too general <span class="dimmed">¬†i.e. not narrower than AB4</span></li>

                <li><code>medium</code>: Some features match but some don't</li>
                <li><code>high</code>: all features match but the features are not very high value to the target user</li>
                <li><code>excellent</code>: the product is very attractive to the target user. i.e. and almost all new features are of high-value to the target user.</li>

              <ul>
                <li><code>low</code>: Hard to understand, often inaccurate or missing important information</li>

                <li><code>high</code>: Mostly easy to follow. Only a few areas for improvements.</li>
                <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow and accurate. Just enough information, visuals, examples etc. (not too much either).</li>
                <li><code>unable to judge</code>: less than 1 page worth of UG content written by the student</li>
              </ul>

            <li>
              <p><strong>C. Amount of work</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate the amount of work on a scale of 0 to 30</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Consider <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/440/files">this PR (<code>history</code> command)</a> as 5 units of effort which means <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/610/files">this PR (<code>undo/redo</code> command)</a>                  is about 15 points of effort. Given that 30 points matches an effort twice as that needed for the <code>undo/redo</code> feature (which was given as an example of an <code>A</code> grade project), we expect most students to be have efforts
                  lower than 20.</li>

                <li>‚ùóÔ∏è Do not give a high value just <em>to be nice</em>. If your estimate is wildly inaccurate, it means you are unable to estimate the effort required to implement a feature in a project that you are supposed to know well at this point.
                  <mark>You will lose marks if that is the case.</mark></li>
                <li>When estimating effort, ignore features that are driven by GUI inputs.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>E. Quality of developer docs</strong> [üë§]: Evaluate based on the developer docs cited/reproduced in the respective project portfolio page. <mark>Evaluate from the perspective of a new developer trying to understand how the features are implemented.</mark></p>
              <ul>

                <li><code>high</code>: Enough diagrams (at lest two kinds of UML diagrams used) and enough descriptions (about 2 pages worth) but explanations are not always easy to follow.</li>
                <li><code>excellent</code>: Easy to follow. Just enough information (not too much). Minimum repetition of content/diagrams. Good use of diagrams to complement text descriptions. Easy to understand diagrams with just enough details rather than

      <p><strong>Bug Review Period</strong>:</p>
      <p>There will be a review period for you to respond to the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/pe-results/issues">bug reports</a> you received.</p>
      <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Wednesday midnight</strong>.</p>
      <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>First, don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is
              not harsh. Furthermore, it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Do not edit the subject or the description. Do not close bug reports.</strong> Your response (if any) should be added as a comment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If the bug is reported multiple times</strong>, mark all copies EXCEPT one as duplicates using the <code>duplicate</code> tag. In addition, use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests/">this technique</a>              to indicate which issue they are duplicates of. Duplicates can be omitted from processing steps given below.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If a bug seems to be for a different product</strong> (i.e. wrongly assigned to your team), let us know (email prof).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Decide if it is a real bug and apply ONLY one of these labels</strong>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <tip-box>
          <p>Response Labels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>response.Accepted</code> : You accept it as a bug.</li>
            <li><code>response.Rejected</code> : What tester thought as a bug is in fact expected behavior. ‚ùóÔ∏è The penalty for rejecting a bug using an unjustifiable explanation is higher than the penalty if the same bug was accepted. You can also reject
              bugs that you inherited from AB4.</li>
            <li><code>response.CannotReproduce</code> : You are unable to reproduce the behavior reported in the bug after multiple tries.</li>

        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Decide who should fix the bug</strong>. Use the <code>Assignees</code> field to assign the issue to that person(s). There is no need to actually fix the bug though. It's simply an indication/acceptance of responsibility. <strong>If there is no assignee and we are unable to determine a suitable assignee ourselves, we'll have no choice but to distribute the penalty for that bug (if any) among all team members.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Add an explanatory comment</strong> explaining your choice of labels and assignees.</p>

      <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your performance in the practical exam will be considered for your final grade (under the <em>QA</em> category and under <em>Implementation</em> category, about 10 marks in total).</li>
        <li>You will be graded based on many bugs in the product you tested and how far off your evaluation/estimates are from the evaluator consensus. <span class="dimmed">¬†Explanation: we understand that you have limited expertise in this area; hence, we penalize only if your inputs don't seem be be based on a sincere effort to test/evaluate.</span></li>

      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less. The less coverage you have, the higher the risk
          of regression bugs, which will cost marks if not fixed before the final submission.</li>
        <li>You <mark>must write <em>some</em> tests</mark> so that we can evaluate your ability to write tests.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly, you can decide to what
          extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test the functional code because
          the code has low testability.</li>
