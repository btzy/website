<p>There is no midterm.</p>
<p>The final exam has two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Part 1: MCQ questions (30 minutes, 25 marks)</li>
  <li>Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour 30 minutes, 55 marks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both papers will be given to you at the start but you need to <strong>answer Part 1 first</strong> (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be <strong>collected 30 minutes after the exam start time</strong> (even if arrived late for the exam). You are free to start
  part 2 early if you finish Part 1 early.</p>
<h2 id="final-exam-part-1-mcq">Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)</h2>
<p>Each MCQ question gives you a statement to evaluate.</p>
<tip-box>
  <p>ðŸ“¦ An example statement</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Testing is a Q&amp;A activity</p>
  </blockquote>
</tip-box>
<p>The meaning of answer options are
  <br>
  <strong>A.</strong> <code>True</code><br>
  <strong>B.</strong> <code>False</code></p>
<p><strong>All questions carry equal marks. There is no penalty for wrong answer.</strong></p>
<p>The exam paper has 50 questions.</p>
<p>Note that you have <strong>slightly more than Â½ minute for each question</strong>, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Given the fast pace required by the paper, to be fair to all students, <strong>you will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions</strong> (in Part 1) by talking to invigilators.</p>
<p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
<p>You will be given OCR forms to indicate your answers for Part 1.</p>
<p><strong>The paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format. However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the exam.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed">Â Reason: Given there are 50 questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.</p>
<h2 id="final-exam-part-2-essay">Final Exam: Part 2 (Essay)</h2>
<p>Unlike in part 1, <strong>you can ask invigilators for clarifications</strong> if you found a question to be unclear in part 2.</p>
<p>Yes, <strong>you may use pencils</strong> when answering part 2.</p>
