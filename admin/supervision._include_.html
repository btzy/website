<p><strong>The tutor's main job is to observe, facilitate self/peer learning, evaluate, and give feedback.</strong></p>
<p>Tutorial time is the main avenue for meeting your tutor. In addition, you can meet the tutor before/after the tutorial, or any other time, as many times you need, subject to availability in his/her schedule.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>it is not the tutorâ€™s job to chase you down and give help</strong>. It is up to you to get as much feedback from the as you need. You are free to request more feedback from the tutor as necessary. Similarly, it is not the job of the
  project supervisor to lead your project to success.</p>
<p>Your Phase B tutor will also be your <em>project supervisor</em>.</p>
